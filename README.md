# AI Project: ANN, CNN & RNN

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** to solve real-world AI tasks. It explores how different deep learning architectures can be applied for classification, prediction, and sequence modeling.

## 🚀 Features

* **ANN (Artificial Neural Network):** General-purpose predictive modeling.
* **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):** Image recognition and feature extraction.
* **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network):** Sequence and time-series data analysis.
* Comparative performance analysis of models.
* Data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation included.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
